# PetCare

## Description
PetCare is a mobile app that aims to replace the medical booklet of your pet. The user can keep a detailed file of what is important about your pet. At first the user inserts the basic information about a specific pet such as name, breed, date of birth and so on. Then it gives the ability to store information for vaccination, medications, baths, grooming and exams. In the exam section the app provides the ability to upload photos in order to keep an updated registry in case it is needed at a veterinarian visit.
